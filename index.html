     Press release for official opening of NexGen 7T</a>.
     Functional connectivity (FC) is the most popular method for recovering
     functional networks of brain areas with fMRI. However, because FC is
     defined as temporal correlations in brain activity, FC networks are
     inevitably confounded by noise and their function cannot be determined
     directly from FC. To overcome these limitations, we have developed model
     connectivity (MC). MC is defined as similarities in encoding model weights,
     which quantify reliable functional activity in terms of interpretable
     stimulus- or task-related features. In this paper we compare these two
     methods directly in a language comprehension dataset. We confirm the
     confounds of FC, and we show that MC does not suffer from these confounds.
     MC recovers more spatially localized networks and it reveals their
     functional assignment. MC is powerful tool for recovering the functional
     networks that support complex cognitive processes.</p>
